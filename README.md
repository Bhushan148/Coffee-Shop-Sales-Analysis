# ‚òï Coffee Shop Sales Analysis Project

## üéØ **Objective**
This project aims to **analyze the sales performance** of a coffee shop using **SQL** for data extraction and **Power BI** for visualization. The analysis focuses on understanding **sales trends**, **order patterns**, and **quantity sold** over time, along with specific insights into **store locations**, **product categories**, and **day-wise performance**.

## üìä **Project Overview**
In this project, I:
- üìù Walked through the data to understand its structure and content.
- üóÉÔ∏è Prepared raw data files and created a **SQL database**.
- üì• Imported and cleaned the data to ensure **accuracy and consistency**.
- üîç Executed **SQL queries** to extract business-relevant insights.
- üìà Developed dynamic and interactive **Power BI dashboards** to visualize key performance indicators (**KPIs**).

## üîÑ **Project Workflow**

### 1. üìÇ **Data Walkthrough**
- **Objective:** Understand the dataset structure, identify key columns, and determine the necessary cleaning steps.
- **Process:** Reviewed data files, identified column types, and mapped out the relationships between different data tables.

### 2. üõ†Ô∏è **Raw Data File Preparation**
- **Objective:** Prepare data files for importing into the SQL database.
- **Process:** Ensured that the raw data files were properly formatted and structured for seamless import.

### 3. üóÑÔ∏è **Creating Database**
- **Objective:** Set up a **SQL database** to store and manage the coffee shop's sales data.
- **Process:** Created a database schema, including tables for **sales**, **orders**, **products**, and **locations**.

### 4. üì§ **Importing File**
- **Objective:** Import raw data files into the SQL database.
- **Process:** Imported data using SQL scripts, ensuring that all records were accurately loaded into the respective tables.

### 5. üßπ **Cleaning Imported File**
- **Objective:** Clean the imported data to ensure **data quality**.
- **Process:** 
  - **Standardized formats** (date, time, text).
  - **Corrected data types** (e.g., dates, numbers, text).
  - **Renamed columns** for clarity.
  - **Removed duplicates** and handled missing values.
  - **Applied constraints** like **NOT NULL** to enforce data integrity.
  - **Eliminated anomalies** and **normalized data**.

### 6. üîß **Changing Data Types**
- **Objective:** Ensure that each column in the dataset has the correct data type.
- **Process:** Modified columns to the appropriate data types, such as converting text to dates or numbers, to facilitate accurate analysis.

### 7. üîç **Firing SQL Queries for Business Requirements**
- **Objective:** Extract insights by running **SQL queries** to calculate **KPIs**.
- **Process:** 
  - Calculated **total sales**, **orders**, and **quantities sold** on a monthly basis.
  - Analyzed **month-over-month (MoM) growth** and differences.
  - Segmented sales by **store location** and **product category**.

### 8. üíæ **Storing Results**
- **Objective:** Store the results of SQL queries for further analysis and visualization.
- **Process:** Saved query results into separate tables or views within the database for easy access during dashboard creation.

### 9. üìù **Preparing SQL Documents**
- **Objective:** Document all SQL queries for transparency and reproducibility.
- **Process:** 
  - Created a comprehensive **SQL query document** detailing each query used in the analysis.
  - Included comments to explain the purpose and logic of each query.
